New York City is chosen as the study area to analyze the ride-hailing industry, as the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles, has released detailed trip data since 2015. Before diving deep into the ride-hailing services provided by big tech companies such as Uber and Lyft, the trend of total trips provided by either taxi or private cars through different organizations and companies is analyzed.
